:bulb: Idea
---------
Develop particle attractor tool with a focus to the juicy specific situation in-game. For example, rewarding players or buying items in the shop, etc. The main reason for the tool is to give players better feelings from specific situations and from a game. The tool should be able to give non-technical department ability for easy use in workflow by a handy editor.

  * Sequence move obj across hand defined path

#### Particle Attractor API
Particle Attractor API is powered by Builder Patter for universal and easy usability.

* SetSourceTransform( Transform source )
* SetDestinationTransform( Transform destination )
* SetSpawnImage( Sprite image )
* SetSpawnAmount( int amount )
* InvokeSpawn()
* InvokeSafeSpawn()
  * Attractor check own state, if should be invoked
* InvokeSafeSpawn(Transform sourcePosition)
* Attractor check own state, if should be invoked
  * sourceTransform used as a default source of particle spawn
* SetAttractorSetupState( bool value)
  * Setup if attractor is configured and ready for Invoke â†’ means this config will be used by next spawn
  * Used in special cases when Invoke is called from another place then config
* SetAsActive()
  * Means currently PA has an active process
